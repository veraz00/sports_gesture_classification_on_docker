	// The `mount` property is used to specify the location of the dataset on the host machine and the location where it should be mounted inside the dev container. In this case, the dataset is located at `/home/linlin/dataset/sports_kaggle/` on the host machine and is mounted at `/home/linlin/dataset/sports_kaggle` inside the dev container.
	// The `type` property is set to `bind`, which means that the dataset is mounted as a bind mount. This allows the dataset to be shared between the host machine and the dev container, and any changes made to the dataset inside the dev container will be reflected on the host machine.
	// The `consistency` property is set to `cached`, which means that the dataset is mounted with cached consistency. This provides better performance when reading from the dataset, but changes made to the dataset on the host machine may not be immediately visible inside the dev container.
